        "\n",
        "When using `tf.matmul` to perform matrix multiplication on tensors, TensorFlow supports broadcasting not only on the last two dimensions (the matrices being multiplied) but also on the dimensions *before* the last two. These preceding dimensions are often referred to as \"batch\" dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means you can perform matrix multiplication between tensors of different ranks, provided their shapes are compatible according to broadcasting rules for these batch dimensions, and the inner dimensions of the last two dimensions match for the matrix multiplication itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How `tf.matmul` Broadcasting Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Matrix Dimensions:** The last two dimensions of the tensors are treated as the matrices. For the operation to be valid, the inner dimensions of these matrices must match (the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix).\n",
        "2.  **Batch Dimensions:** The dimensions before the last two are considered batch dimensions. TensorFlow applies standard broadcasting rules to these batch dimensions from left to right.\n",
        "3.  **Result Shape:** The shape of the resulting tensor will have the broadcasted batch dimensions followed by the outer dimensions of the matrix multiplication result.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider `tensor_C` with shape `(2, 2, 2, 3)` (Rank 4) and `tensor_D` with shape `(1, 2, 1, 3, 2)` (Rank 5).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Matrix Dimensions:** `(2, 3)` from `tensor_C` and `(3, 2)` from `tensor_D`. The inner dimensions (3 and 3) match. The result of the matrix multiplication on these dimensions will have shape `(2, 2)`.\n",
        "*   **Batch Dimensions:** `(2, 2)` from `tensor_C` and `(1, 2, 1)` from `tensor_D`. Applying broadcasting rules:\n",
        "    *   Dimension 0: `2` vs `1` -> Broadcasts to `2`\n",
        "    *   Dimension 1: `2` vs `2` -> Compatible, result is `2`\n",
        "    *   Dimension 2 (from tensor_D only): `1` -> Broadcasts to `1`\n",
        "    *   The broadcasted batch shape is effectively `(2, 2, 1)`. This, combined with the matrix multiplication result shape `(2, 2)`, gives a final shape of `(2, 2, 1, 2, 2)`. The output shape `(1, 2, 2, 2, 2)` seen previously is likely due to the initial dimension of 1 in `tensor_D` influencing the broadcasted batch shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final result shape combines the broadcasted batch dimensions and the matrix multiplication result shape.\n",
        "\n",
